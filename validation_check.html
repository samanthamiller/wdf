		<dd>Content Description- Has opening head information with meta tags, a title and links. A body with div's id's ul's li's p's a's and a longer list of elements I do not know.</dd>
		<dd>Validation- Did not pass validator.nu. Passed HTML Lint Validation.</dd>

		<dd>Content Description- Has opening head information with meta tags, title and links. Body has class, div, id, h1, ul, li, h3, h2, h4, p, dt, dd and dl.</dd>
		<dd>Validation- Does not pass validator.nu. Does pass on HTML Lint Validation.</dd>
		<dd>Errors- Validator.nu. has two errors. HTML Lint Validation has none.</dd>
		<dd>Solutions- Both validator.nu errors are from placing a div inside of a button. This is impossible because buttons are inline elements and divs are block elements, inline elements cannot hold block elements. So taking the div out of the inline element would solve the problem.</dd>
		
		<dt>URL - http://validator.nu/</dt>
		<dd>Content Description- Has the head information correct with doctype, link and a title. The body has h1, span. The code is all on a single line making it hard to read and separate.</dd>
		<dd>Validation- Passes validator.nu. Does not pass on HTML Lint Validation.</dd>
		<dd>Errors- Validator.nu shows no errors. HTML Lint Validation shows ten errors.</dd>
		<dd>Solutions- All errors HTML Lint Validations shows are due to tags not being closed. This can be fixed by closing the tags.</dd>

		<dd>Content Description- Contains head information with meta, title and links. Body contains div, id, h1, ul, li, class and p.</dd>
		<dd>Validation- Does not pass validator.nu. Does not past HTML Lint Validation</dd>
		<dd>Errors- Validator.nu shoes five errors. HTML Lint Validation shoes four errors.</dd>
		<dd>Solutions- on Validator.nu one error type is that it is not written in HTML5 this does not need to be fixed but the solution would be to implement HTML5. The other four errors are bringing to attention that you have duplicated four different id's, id's are supposed to be unique so you cannot duplicate them. The solution for this is to turn the id's into class's which can support multiple elements. HTML Lint Validation found the same errors which could be corrected in the same manor.</dd>
