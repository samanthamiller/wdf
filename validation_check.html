		<dd>Validation- Did not pass validator.nu. Passed HTML Lint Validation.</dd>

		<dd>Content Description- Has opening head information with meta tags, title and links. Body has class, div, id, h1, ul, li, h3, h2, h4, p, dt, dd and dl.</dd>
		<dd>Validation- Does not pass validator.nu. Does pass on HTML Lint Validation.</dd>
		<dd>Errors- Validator.nu. has two errors. HTML Lint Validation has none.</dd>
		<dd>Solutions- Both validator.nu errors are from placing a div inside of a button. This is impossible because buttons are inline elements and divs are block elements, inline elements cannot hold block elements. So taking the div out of the inline element would solve the problem.</dd>
		
		<dt>URL - http://validator.nu/</dt>
		<dd>Content Description- Has the head information correct with doctype, link and a title. The body has h1, span. The code is all on a single line making it hard to read and separate.</dd>
		<dd>Validation- Passes validator.nu. Does not pass on HTML Lint Validation.</dd>
		<dd>Errors- Validator.nu shows no errors. HTML Lint Validation shows ten errors.</dd>
		<dd>Solutions- All errors HTML Lint Validations shows are due to tags not being closed. This can be fixed by closing the tags.</dd>
