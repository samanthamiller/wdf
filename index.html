		<h1>Fried Potatoes and Hot Dogs</h1>
		<p>Fried Potatoes and Hot Dogs, my mamo would fix regularly. I think it was a meal stretcher - she'd throw in this economic meal in the middle of the week, open up a can of pork and beans or corn and we had a tasty meal.</p>

			<li>6 medium sized potatoes sliced thin</li>
			<li>1 large onion chopped</li>
			<li>1 package of hot dogs (Sliced)</li>
			<li>1 Stick of Butter</li>
		</ul>	
		<h2>Directions</h2>
		<h3>* Cook times may vary pending on gas or electric stoves</h3>
		<ol>

			<li>Add sliced hot dogs to the mix until heated through.</li>
		</ol>
