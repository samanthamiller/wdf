	<h3><a href="http://html5-showcase.com/2013/02/vogue-uk/" title="Link to Vouge UK's website">Vouge UK</a>-</h3> Vouge's content includes photos, current events, navigation, blogs, external and internal links. They do not use HTML5 properly, they have headers that are not labeled and not enough sections to make the outline make since and follow their site structure. To fix errors they could add labels to their headings, add sections to label their subheadings and articles for their RSS feed as well as making sure their code is in the semantic order of the web page.

	<h3><a href="http://keiyasui.com/" title="Link to Keiyasui's website">Keiyasui</a>-</h3> Keiyasui's content includes photos, navigation, external and internal links. For the most part the use HTML5 properly. There are a couple "Untitled Section"s which as far as I can tell are simple because it is a nav function which does not need a title per say.

	<h3><a href="http://www.codeman.co/" title="Link to Codeman's website">Codeman</a>-</h3> Codemans's content includes photos, navigation, external and internal links. For being the "codeman" his HTML5 structure is lacking, there is none. When ran through the outline only one thing pops up and it pops up as an "Untitled Section". To fix these errors he should implement everything in the HTML5 structure.

		<h3><a href="http://shellheroes.csharks.com/game.php" title="Link to Shell Heroes website">Shell Heroes</a>-</h3> Shell Hero's content includes a background and a game platform. In the outline only one "Untitled Section" shows up. This is the header section being called out which is appropriate because there is no need to name the header being that all the websites content is in the game platform which uses another language to host it.
